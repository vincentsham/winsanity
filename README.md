## 🧠 How It Works: The Agent Pipeline

When a user views a stock (e.g., NVDA), the system triggers a multi-step pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Fetches real-time price, OHLCV, and raw financial statements.
2.  **Context Retrieval:** Pulls transcripts from the latest earnings calls and recent news headlines.
3.  **Agent Processing:**
    * *Catalyst Agent:* Classifies news into "Bullish" or "Bearish" buckets.
    * *Fundamental Agent:* Calculates percentile rankings against the tracked cohort.
4.  **Synthesis:** The "Supervisor" agent compiles these distinct streams into the final **Win Score** and renders the report via Server Components.
